# heart-disease-data
I've been using various Python libraries and tools for the heart disease data set project. 
Colab Notebook: An interactive environment where we wrote and executed our Python code. It allowed us to combine code, outputs, and documentation in a single document.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used to handle the heart disease dataset. It was used for data loading, cleaning, and preparation.
NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
Matplotlib: A plotting library used to create various visualizations, such as line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts.
Seaborn: A high-level data visualization library based on Matplotlib, used to create visually appealing and informative statistical graphics.
Sklearn: A comprehensive machine learning library used for model selection, training, and evaluation. We used it to train Logistic Regression and Neural Network models and evaluate their performance.
Eli5: A library that provides methods for debugging machine learning models and computing feature importances. We used it to visualize decision boundaries.
To run the code, we executed it in the Colab Notebook environment. This involved running code blocks one by one or running the entire notebook at once. Additionally, we installed necessary packages using the !pip install command in Colab Notebook.
This combination of tools allowed us to explore the heart disease dataset, apply machine learning models, and visualize the results effectively.
